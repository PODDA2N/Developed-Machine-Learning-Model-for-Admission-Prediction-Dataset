This project predicts the likelihood of a student's admission to a university using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes academic and profile features like GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, Research experience, and more.

ðŸ”§ Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Graduate Admissions dataset
Features: GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research
Target: Chance of Admission

ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib
Model Building using Scikit-learn
Model Evaluation with RÂ², RMSE, Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Model Comparison and selection of best-performing model

âœ… Outcome
Random Forest performed best with ~90% accuracy
Feature importance helped identify top admission factor
